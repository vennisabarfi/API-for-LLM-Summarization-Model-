Built an API to deploy a Large Language Model

# Project Description: Multilingual Text Summarization API

This project provides an API for text summarization using the Hugging Face Transformers library and FastAPI. The core functionality of the API is to generate concise summaries of input text based on user-defined parameters.

## Features:
1. **Easy Integration:** The API is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+. It allows for easy integration and deployment.

2. **Transformer Model:** Leveraging the transformers library, the API utilizes the state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model, specifically "facebook/bart-large-cnn," for text summarization.

3. **User-Defined Parameters:** Users have the flexibility to customize the summarization process by specifying the maximum and minimum length of the summary. This is achieved through the `SummarizationParams` class.

4. **Multilingual Support:** The API is designed to handle text in various languages, thanks to the multilingual capabilities of the underlying transformer model.

5. **Interactive Documentation:** The API comes with interactive documentation generated by FastAPI. Users can explore and test the functionality through Swagger-based documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs or ReDoc at http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc.

## Languages and Tools Used:
- **Python:** The core programming language used for developing the API.
- **FastAPI:** A modern, fast, web framework used for building the API endpoints.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** A powerful library for working with state-of-the-art natural language processing models. The chosen model is "facebook/bart-large-cnn" for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- **uvicorn:** ASGI server that runs the FastAPI application.
- **pydantic:** Used for data validation and defining the input data models.

## Model and Tokenizer:
- **Model:** The API uses the "facebook/bart-large-cnn" model for sequence-to-sequence text summarization.
- **Tokenizer:** The tokenizer associated with the model is also "facebook/bart-large-cnn."

## Usage:
1. **Endpoint:** The API endpoint for text summarization is `/fbsummarize_text`, and it handles POST requests.

2. **Input:** Users can send a POST request with a JSON payload containing the input text and optional summarization parameters.

3. **Output:** The API returns a JSON response containing the summarized text based on the provided input and parameters.

## Example:
```python
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/fbsummarize_text"
data = {
    "text": "Your input text goes here.",
    "params": {
        "max_length": 150,  # Set your desired maximum length
        "min_length": 30    # Set your desired minimum length
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

## How to Run:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the API using the following command:
   ```
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
3. Access interactive documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs or http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc.

Feel free to customize and extend this project to suit your specific needs. Happy summarizing!
